Remove the "$googleformwebpage" it's dual hook on status.php

Done? Press the Upload Files button (you know where it is), press select files and then select all of the downloaded files, after that press Upload and then wait until it is done.

Open the file named "send.php" and then press Ctrl + F. Type "yourwebhook" in the box and then press enter. Now, this is the tricky part. Put your prepared webhook and then put it in the highlighted part.

OK, nice. After that press "Save & Close"

Next step! Go to https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/ and then click new form. After creating a new form, you can customize it however you want, go crazy. Now, press the preview (eye icon) button at the top right corner.

After that press Ctrl + U on the page, press Ctrl + F on the new page that you got redirected to, and look for "form action=" It should look something like this form action="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4NPbI6X_Nc8yS89t86hLNjwQbk_JzfI3fFPbGHBL8whOmsg/formResponse

Found it? Copy the URL and then paste it onto a notepad or somewhere.

After that go back to the preview page and then press Ctrl + Shift + I. What you are looking for this time is entry.(numbers) It should look something like this <input type="hidden" name="entry.895940829" value=""> Ok, this time, copy the entry.895940829 of yours and then paste it in the name notepad as the previous URL.

Now the full address will be constructed as follows:
[actionURL]?[entry]=

In my case the full URL looked like this:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIp_____CFPoQg/formResponse?entry.1928374650=

Now that you have got that, open "form.php" and then paste the link you constructed on the part that is yoururlhere, Press "Save & Close"

And that's it, you have set up the method!

HTML method:

This is like the studio method but not as known. There's a 50/50 percent of people falling for this. (actually kind of complicated, lol.)

Anyway, let me explain. Tell them to open any game on ROBLOX and make sure they have this pop-up: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/708019811384557599/761013633610022912/unknown.png / Idk if it works without the pop up because I never tried it yet. (probably works, though)

Once they open it, redirect them to "Elements" and tell them to copy the blue HTML, which looks like this: "<html> / <html data-btr-loaded" on top of the actual element page. Tell them to paste it into your chat DMS. Open the "message.txt" they sent you. Their auth key is in there before doing anything—Press "Format" and press Word Wrap. Once done, press CTRL+F and search for "+gameinfo," that's their auth key. IF you don't know how to log in to someone's account with their auth key, please read up the studio method. I explained how to log in to people's accounts with it properly.

Gmail AKA BeEf Xss
Gmail XSS. Things you will need A VM with Kali Linux, BeEF.

1) Once you have your virtual machine with Kali Linux on it, install BeEF. It's a pain to install but it's worth it. When customizing the site, but redirect to whatever site you want to get the cookies from.

2) Now for the easy part, get the victim to click the link you created or spoofed with BeEF.

3) After they have done that, wait a few seconds on your virtual machine, then click on "commands".

4) Search for "google phishing"

5) On the right the information will show up; log in to that, and change the Roblox email and password.
